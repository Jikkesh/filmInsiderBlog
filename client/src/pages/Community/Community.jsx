        <p>
          Hi, I'm the  founder of FilmInsider. I'm thrilled to
          have you here and be a part of our growing film community.

        <h2 className="community-subtitle">About Me</h2>
        <p>
          My passion for cinema and the entertainment industry has been a
          driving force behind the creation of FilmInsider. Having been an
          avid movie enthusiast myself, I realized the need for a platform that
          celebrates the diverse world of Indian cinema.

        <h2 className="community-subtitle">Why FilmInsider?</h2>
        <p>
          India is home to one of the most vibrant and prolific film industries
          in the world. Yet, there was a gap when it came to a comprehensive and
          community-driven platform for film enthusiasts. FilmInsider aims to
          bridge that gap by providing a space where film lovers, cinephiles,
          and aspiring filmmakers can come together to explore, discuss, and
          celebrate Indian cinema.

        <h2 className="community-subtitle">Our Vision</h2>
        <p>
          Our vision for FilmInsider is to create a thriving community that
          not only appreciates mainstream cinema but also explores regional
          films, independent projects, and hidden gems. We want to foster
          meaningful conversations, share insights, and ultimately, contribute
          to the growth and recognition of Indian cinema on a global scale.
